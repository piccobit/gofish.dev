<a href=#about>About</a>
</h1><div class=content>
<p>GoFish works across all three major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux). It installs packages into its own directory and symlinks their files into <code>/usr/local</code> (or <code>C:\ProgramData</code> for Windows). You can think of it as the cross-platform Homebrew.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ cd /usr/local/Fish

<p>GoFish accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.</p><h2 id=reporting-a-security-issue>Reporting a Security Issue</h2><p>Most of the time, when you find a bug in GoFish, it should be reported using <a href=https://github.com/fishworks/gofish/issues>GitHub issues</a>.
However, if you are reporting a <em>security vulnerability</em>, please email a report to <a href=mailto:matt.fisher+security-issues@fishworks.io>Matt Fisher</a>
directly. This will give myself a chance to try to fix the issue before it is exploited in the wild.</p><h2 id=support-channels>Support Channels</h2><p>Whether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:</p><ul>
<li>GitHub <a href=https://github.com/fishworks/gofish/issues>issues</a></li><li>IRC - tbd at a later date</li></ul><p>Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it&rsquo;s helpful to search the project - it&rsquo;s likely that another user has already reported the issue you&rsquo;re facing, or it&rsquo;s a known issue that we&rsquo;re already aware of.</p><h2 id=milestones>Milestones</h2><p>We use milestones to track progress of releases. A milestone (and hence release) is considered done
when all outstanding issues/PRs have been closed or moved to another milestone.</p><h2 id=semver>Semver</h2><p>GoFish maintains a strong commitment to backward compatibility. All of our changes to protocols and
formats are backward compatible from GoFish 1.0 until GoFish 2.0. No features, flags, or commands are
removed or substantially modified (other than bug fixes).</p><p>We also try very hard to not change publicly accessible Go library definitions inside of the <code>pkg/</code>
directory of our source code, but it is not guaranteed to be backwards compatible as we move the
project forward.</p><p>If there&rsquo;s some package you rely on inside of GoFish that would be useful to split out and maintain
separately, <a href=https://github.com/fishworks/gofish/issues/new>open an issue to discuss it!</a></p><p>For a quick summary of our backward compatibility guidelines for releases between 1.0 and 2.0:</p><ul>
<li>Command line commands, flags, and arguments MUST be backward compatible</li><li>Directory formats within /usr/local/Fish MUST be backward compatible</li><li>Any fish food that worked on a previous version of GoFish MUST work on a new version of GoFish, barring the cases where
<ul>
<li>it is out of our control, e.g. the Operating System itself changed, and</li><li>the fish food worked because it exploited a bug</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=issues>Issues</h2><p>Issues are used as the primary method for tracking anything to do with the GoFish project.</p><h3 id=issue-types>Issue Types</h3><p>There are 4 types of issues (each with their own corresponding <a href=#labels>label</a>):</p><h4 id=questionsupport>Question/Support</h4><p>These are support or functionality inquiries that we want to have a record of for future reference.
Depending on the discussion, it may require further information from the user before these can turn
into Feature or Bug issues.</p><h4 id=proposal>Proposal</h4><p>Used for items that propose a new ideas or functionality that require a larger community discussion.
This allows for feedback from others in the community before a feature is actually developed. This
is not needed for small additions. Final word on whether or not a featureneeds a proposal is up to
the core maintainers. All issues that are proposals should both have a label and an issue title of
&ldquo;Proposal: [the rest of the title].&rdquo; A proposal can become a Feature and does not require a
milestone.</p><h4 id=feature>Feature</h4><p>These track specific feature requests and ideas until they are complete. They can evolve from a
Proposal or can be submitted individually depending on the size.</p><h4 id=bug>Bug</h4><p>These track bugs with the code or problems with the documentation (i.e. missing or incomplete)</p><h3 id=issue-lifecycle>Issue Lifecycle</h3><p>The issue lifecycle is mainly driven by the core maintainers, but is good information for those
contributing to GoFish. All issue types follow the same general lifecycle. Differences are noted below.</p><ol>
<li>Issue creation</li><li>Triage
<ul>
<li>The maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. This
includes labels for priority, type, and metadata (such as &ldquo;starter&rdquo;). The only issue
priority we will be tracking is whether or not the issue is &ldquo;critical.&rdquo; If additional
levels are needed in the future, we will add them.</li><li>(If needed) Clean up the title to succinctly and clearly state the issue. Also ensure
that proposals are prefaced with &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;.</li><li>Add the issue to the correct milestone. If any questions come up, don&rsquo;t worry about
adding the issue to a milestone until the questions are answered.</li><li>We attempt to do this process at least once per work day.</li></ul></li><li>Discussion
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Feature&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; issues should be connected to the PR that resolves it.</li><li>Whoever is working on a &ldquo;Feature&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; issue (whether a maintainer or someone from
the community), should either assign the issue to them self or make a comment in the issue
saying that they are taking it.</li><li>&ldquo;Proposal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Question&rdquo; issues should stay open until resolved or if they have not been
active for more than 30 days. This will help keep the issue queue to a manageable size and
reduce noise. Should the issue need to stay open, the <code>keep open</code> label can be added.</li></ul></li><li>Issue closure</li></ol><h2 id=how-to-contribute-a-patch>How to Contribute a Patch</h2><ol>
<li>Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.</li><li>Submit a pull request.</li></ol><p>The next section contains more information on the workflow followed for PRs</p><h2 id=pull-requests>Pull Requests</h2><p>Like any good open source project, we use Pull Requests to track code changes.</p><h3 id=pr-lifecycle>PR Lifecycle</h3><ol>
<li>PR creation
<ul>
<li>We more than welcome PRs that are currently in progress. They are a great way to keep track of
important work that is in-flight, but useful for others to see. If a PR is a work in progress,
it <strong>must</strong> be prefaced with &ldquo;WIP: [title]&rdquo;. Once the PR is ready for review, remove &ldquo;WIP&rdquo; from
the title.</li><li>It is preferred, but not required, to have a PR tied to a specific issue.</li></ul></li><li>Triage
<ul>
<li>The maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. This should
include at least a size label, <code>bug</code> or <code>feature</code>, and <code>awaiting review</code> once all labels are applied.
See the <a href=#labels>Labels section</a> for full details on the definitions of labels</li><li>Add the PR to the correct milestone. This should be the same as the issue the PR closes.</li></ul></li><li>Assigning reviews
<ul>
<li>Once a review has the <code>awaiting review</code> label, maintainers will review them as schedule permits.
The maintainer who takes the issue should self-request a review.</li><li>Reviews from others in the community, especially those who have encountered a bug or have
requested a feature, are highly encouraged, but not required. Maintainer reviews <strong>are</strong> required
before any merge</li><li>Any PR with the <code>size/large</code> label requires 2 review approvals from maintainers before it can be
merged. Those with <code>size/medium</code> are per the judgement of the maintainers</li></ul></li><li>Reviewing/Discussion
<ul>
<li>All reviews will be completed using Github review tool.</li><li>A &ldquo;Comment&rdquo; review should be used when there are questions about the code that should be
answered, but that don&rsquo;t involve code changes. This type of review does not count as approval.</li><li>A &ldquo;Changes Requested&rdquo; review indicates that changes to the code need to be made before they will be merged.</li></ul></li><li>Address comments by answering questions or changing code</li><li>Merge or close
<ul>
<li>PRs should stay open until merged or if they have not been active for more than 30 days.
This will help keep the PR queue to a manageable size and reduce noise. Should the PR need
to stay open (like in the case of a WIP), the <code>keep open</code> label can be added.</li><li>If the owner of the PR is listed in <code>OWNERS</code>, that user <strong>must</strong> merge their own PRs
or explicitly request another OWNER do that for them.</li><li>If the owner of a PR is <em>not</em> listed in <code>OWNERS</code>, any core committer may
merge the PR once it is approved.</li></ul></li></ol><h4 id=a-note-about-documentation-prs>A note about Documentation PRs</h4><p>Documentation PRs will follow the same lifecycle as other PRs. They will also be labeled with the
<code>docs</code> label. For documentation, special attention will be paid to spelling, grammar, and clarity
(whereas those things don&rsquo;t matter <em>as</em> much for comments in code).</p><h2 id=labels>Labels</h2><p>The following tables define all label types used for GoFish. It is split up by category.</p><h3 id=common>Common</h3><table>
