It installs packages into its own directory and symlinks their files into /usr/local (or C:\ProgramData for Windows). You can think of it as the cross-platform Homebrew.

These instructions will help you set up a development environment for working on the GoFish source code.
Prerequisites To compile and test GoFish, you will need:
git Go 1.10 or later In most cases, install each prerequisite according to its instructions.
Fork the Repository Begin at Github by forking GoFish, then clone your fork locally. Since GoFish is a Go package, it should be located at $GOPATH/src/github.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to GoFish</title><link>/gofish.dev/homepage/contributing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gofish.dev/homepage/contributing/</guid><description>GoFish accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.
Reporting a Security Issue Most of the time, when you find a bug in GoFish, it should be reported using GitHub issues. However, if you are reporting a security vulnerability, please email a report to Matt Fisher directly. This will give myself a chance to try to fix the issue before it is exploited in the wild.</description></item><item><title>Code of Conduct</title><link>/gofish.dev/homepage/code-of-conduct/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/gofish.dev/homepage/code-of-conduct/</guid><description>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
